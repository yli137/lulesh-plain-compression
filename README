Working on getting plain compression. There is a segfault need to be debugged.

**8/20/2024**

restarted plain compression. Need to add tryDecompression after each mpi wait

**9/10/2024**

Realized that MPI_Irecv are also batched. Wrote a function to put receiving address and request into a list. Still need a function to wait for all MPI_Irecvs and try_decompress.
